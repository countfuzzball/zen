On linux:

find <directory> -type f -exec md5sum {} + > ~/md5.txt

To verify:

 md5sum -c ~/md5.txt

To find only failed files:

 md5sum -c ~/md5.txt | grep FAILED

I don't know exactly how Unraid operates, but if these errors are being detected from parity, the check probably auto-restores the correct data.

To exclude a directory:
find <directory> -not -path "./path/to/exclude/*" -type f -exec md5sum {} + > ~/md5.txt
